# texlive-mwe
A collection of minimal-working-examples for various texlive-packages.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to produce many "minimal-working-examples" as explained by
https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/228/ive-just-been-asked-to-write-a-minimal-working-example-mwe-what-is-that

One of the problems with LaTeX-packages on CTAN/TeXLive is that you first need to browse through the 
sometimes non-optimal documentation of the package just to find that there is no MWE in there.

This project wants to help out.

As a by-product, it is used as an experimentation lab to examine package dependencies which are
not explicitly stated for many packages.

# What to expect

1. Every folder has the name of a package.
2. Every folder has one file *mwe.tex* that uses that package.
3. There may be more MWE which will be named, mwe-2.tex, mwe-3.tex, etc.
